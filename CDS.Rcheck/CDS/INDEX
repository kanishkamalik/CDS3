CDS                     Build a CDS class object to include relevant
                        info about a CDS contract
CDS-class               Class definition for the CDS package
CS10                    Calculate the CS10 of a CDS contract
busDaysOffset           function to pass R objects to compiled C code
                        loaded into R
calcIRDV01              Calculate the IR DV01 from conventional spread
calcRecRisk01           Calculate the amount of change in upfront when
                        there is a 1 increase in recovery rate.
calcSpread              Calculate conventional spread from upfront
calcSpreadDV01          Calculate the spread DV01 from conventional
                        spread
calcUpfront             Calculate dirty upfront payments from
                        conventional spread
defaultExpo             Calculate the default exposure of a CDS
                        contract based on the formula: Default
                        Exposure: (1-Recovery Rate)*Notional -
                        Principal
defaultProb             Approximate the default probability at time t
                        given the parSpread
getDates                The function gets relevant coupon dates for a
                        CDS contract.
getRates                The function returns the deposits and swap
                        rates for the day input. The day input should
                        be a weekday. If not, go to the most recent
                        weekday.
impliedRecoveryRate     Function that uses the ISDA model to calculate
                        the implied recovery rate for cases in which we
                        have a spread and a probability of default
                        (pd). This could take a dataframe of inputs and
                        return a vector of the same length. If we have
                        a data frame like: id,spread,pd which we pass
                        into a function, this then returns a vector of
                        implied default rates. Typical size for this
                        dataframe is 500 rows.
price                   Calculate the price of a CDS contract
show                    The show method for CDS class
summary,CDS-method      The summary method displays only the essential
                        info about the CDS class object.
update,CDS-method       update spread or ptsUpfront or upfront based on
                        a new CDS class object.
